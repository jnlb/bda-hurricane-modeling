## Hurricane introduction

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = '..')
```


```{r, include=FALSE}
source("init.r", local = knitr::knit_global())
hurricane <- file.path(getwd(), img_path, "hurricane.jpg")
path <- file.path(getwd(), img_path, "corrplot_delta_small_presentation_centered.png")
```

- Destructive storms occuring in the late summer and fall in the northern hemisphere’s tropical region.   
- Classified by their wind intensity at the eye wall.  
- They can cause extreme levels of flooding and destroy many buildings.  
- Monetary damages and loss of lives increase with an almost exponential character as a function of storm intensity.

## Hurricane forecasting basics

- Forecasters predict two quantities: track and intensity
- Two kinds of models: _dynamical_ and _statistical_
    - Dynamical: simulate the laws of physics
    - Statistical: estimate based on historical data
- Dynamical vs. statistical: good at long- and short-range forecasts respectively
- _Rapid intensification_: forecasted better by dynamical models
- This project: a _statistical_ model for _intensity_
